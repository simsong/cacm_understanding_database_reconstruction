In order to show how a SAT solver can be used to rapidly narrow down the solution universe for a data set, we will perform a mock DRA on a new, larger set of responses to the survey given earlier.

The ground truth responses from two new households are given in Table~\ref{resultsbig}. The statistical agency publishes the statistics in Table~\ref{publishedstatsbig} after processing the ground truth responses.
