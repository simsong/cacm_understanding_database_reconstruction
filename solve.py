# use SAT solver? SMT solver (find python implementation)? or just simultaneous eqn solver (for small size)?

# need to know:
# format of input datafile
# how to encode each non-boolean variables into boolean

# Structure
# read file
# extract data into List for processing, where each entry represents a 'person'
# synthesize the preliminary constraint equations by extracting the corresponding data from each person into Lists
# Form the actual equations (floating point rounding transformations, etc.)
