\begin{abstract}
Statistical agencies are mandated to publish summary statistics and
micro-data while not providing data users with the ability to derive
specific attributes for particular persons or
establishments. 
Traditionally, these privacy guarantees are assured through the
use of \emph{Statistical Disclosure Limitation} (SDL)
techniques. These techniques are not sufficient to
prevent a database reconstruction attack of the sort anticipated by
Dinur and Nissim (2003). To illustrate the problem, this paper
presents a database reconstruction attack on a hypothetical block for
which statistics have been published by an official statistics
agency. We then show how the use of formally private noise reduces the
privacy risk of the database reconstruction. The paper concludes with
a discussion of the implications for the 2020 Census of Population and
Housing.

\section{Introduction}
In 2020 the Census Bureau will conduct the constitutionally mandated
decennial Census of Population and Housing, with the goal of counting
every person once, and only once, and in the correct place, and to
fulfill the Constitutional requirement to apportion the seats in the
U.S. House of Representatives among the states according to their
respective numbers.

Beyond the Constitutionally mandated role of the decennial census, the
US Congress has mandated many other purposes for the data. For
example, the U.S. Department of Justice uses block-by-block counts by
race for enforcing the Voting Rights Act. More generally, the results
of the decennial census, combined with other data, are used to help
distribute more than \$675 billion in federal funds to states and
local organizations.

In addition to collecting and distributing data on the American
people, the Census Bureau is charged with protecting the Privacy confidentiality of
survey responses. Specifically, all Census publications must uphold the
confidentiality standard specified by Title 13 of the U.S. Code, which
states, in part, that Bureau publications are prohibited from
identifying ``the data furnished by any particular
establishment or individual.''[Title 13, Section 9] This section
prohibits the Bureau from publishing respondent names, addresses, or any other
information that might identify a specific person or establishment.

Upholding this confidentiality requirement frequently poses a
challenge, because many statistical can inadvertently provide
information in a way that can be attributed to a particular
entity. For example, a survey of salaries in a region might report the
average salary earned by people of different occupations. However, if
there is only one bricklayer, than reporting the average salary of a
bricklayer will allow anyone who sees to statistical product to infer
that person's salary. If there are two bricklayers in the region,
reporting the average salary will allow each bricklayer to infer the
other's salary. Both of these cases would be clear violations of Title
13. The Bureau has traditionally used cell suppression to protect
privacy in situations such as this: the cells of statistical tables
that result from \emph{small counts} are suppressed and not
reported. If totals are reported, cell suppression requires that
additional \emph{complementary} cells be suppressed so that the values
of the suppressed cells cannot be worked out with simple arithmetic. 

In 2003, Dinur and Nissim showed that simple cell
suppression is not sufficient to protect the underlying confidential
data collected and used by a statistical agency to produce official
statistics\cite{DinurNissim2003}. To the contrary, they showed that
once an agency publishes more than a critical number of statistics,
the underlying confidential data can be \emph{reconstructed} by simply
finding a consistent set of microdata that, when tabulated, produce
the official statistics. One of the big surprises of the 2003 paper is
that the number of tabulations required to enable a database reconstruction
attack (DRA) is far fewer than might be intuitively expected: this is
because of the internal constraints and consistency requirements
in the published data. 

While it is mathematically impossible prevent reconstruction of the
underlying data, a data publisher can add noise to the published
results so that the reconstructed data will not reveal the actual
confidential responses that was used to create the published
tables. Clearly, as more noise that is added, the respondents will
enjoy greater privacy protection, but the data publications will have
less resulting accuracy. 

So how much noise needs to be added to protect privacy? Three years
later, Dwork, McSherry, Nissim and Smith answered that question. In
their paper ``Calibrating Noise to Sensitivity in Private Data
Analysis,''\cite{Dwork:2006:CNS:2180286.2180305} the researchers
introduced the concept of \emph{differential privacy}. The paper
provides a mathematical definition of the privacy loss that
persons suffer as a result of a data publication, and proposes a
mechanism for determining how much noise needs to be added for any
given level of privacy protection.

The 2020 census is expected to count roughly 320 million people living
on roughly 8.5 million inhabited blocks, with some blocks having as
few as a single person and other blocks having thousands. With this
level of scale and diversity, it is difficult to visualize how such a
data release might be susceptible to a database reconstruction
attack. Nevertheless, with recent improvements in both computing power
and big data applications, such reconstructions now pose a significant
risk to the confidentiality of microdata that underlies unprotected
statistical tables.

To help understand the importance of adopting formal privacy methods, in
this article we presents a database reconstruction attack on a much
smaller statistical publication: a hypothetical block containing seven
people distributed over two households. We show that even a relatively
small number of constraints results in an exact solution the blocks'
inhabitants. Finally, we show how differential privacy can protect the
published data by creating uncertainty. Finally, we discuss
implications for the decennial census.

\section{An Example Database Reconstruction Attack}

To present the attack, we consider the 
census of a fictional geographic frame (for example, a suburban block),
conducted by a fictional statistical
agency. For every block, the agency collects each resident's age,
sex and race, and publishes a variety of statistics. To simplify the example,
the fictional world has only two races, black and white, and two
sexes, female and male. The statistical agency
is prohibited from publishing the raw microdata, and instead publishes
a tabular report (Table~\ref{fictional}). 

Notice that a substantial amount of information in
Table~\ref{fictional} has been suppressed (censored). In this case,
the statistical agency's disclosure avoidance rules prohibit it from
publishing statistics based on one or two people. This suppression rule is
sometimes called ``the rule of three,'' because cells in the report
sourced from fewer than three people are suppressed.

\end{table}

\subsection{Encoding the Constraints}

To perform the database reconstruction attack, we view the attributes
of the persons living on the block as a collection of 
free variables. We then extract from the published table a set of
constraints. The database reconstruct attack merely finds a set of
attributes that are consistent with the constraints. If statistics are
highly constrained, the only a single reconstruction will be
possible, and that reconstruction should be the same as the underlying
microdata used to create original table.

For example, statistic 2B states that there are 3 males living in the
geography.  Because age is reported to the nearest year, and
age must necessarily $0 \le \textrm{age} \le 115$. As a result, there
are only a finite number of possible age combinations, specifically:

\[ \binom{116}{3}=\frac{116 \times 115 \times 114}{3 \times 2 \times
  1} = 253,460 \]

\input{medians} % brings in \mycount also

Within these sets, there are \mycount{} combinations that satisfy the
constraint of having a median of \mymedian{} and a mean of \mymean{}
(Table~\ref{fictional}). So by applying the constraints imposed by the
published statistical tables, we are able to reduce the possible
combinations of ages for the three males from 253,460 to \mycount.

To mount a full reconstruction attack, an attacker extracts all of the
constraints specified by the published statistics and then creates a
single mathematical model that reflects all of the
constraints.  
Although this might seem difficult to compute in practice,
computational advances within the past decade have made such
reconstruction attacks relatively straightforward.

\end{tabular}
\caption{The variables associated with the database reconstruction
  attack. The coding for categorical attributes is presented in the key.}\label{variables}
\end{table}

\end{center}

To continue with our example, recall that statistic 2B contains three
constraints: there are three males, their median age is 30, and their
average age is 44. In our example, female persons
are represented by 0
and male persons by 1, so the constraint that there are three males can be represented as:

\begin{equation}
(1-S1) + (1-S2) + (1-S3) + (1-S3) + (1-S5) + (1-S6) + (1-S7) = 3
\end{equation}

We can use this to represent the constraint for the average age of the
male persons which sums each age if the corresponding sex is 1 (males):

\begin{equation}
\frac{
  \begin{split}
  A1 \times (1-S1) + A2 \times (1-S2) + A3 \times (1-S3) + \\
   A4 \times (1-S4) + A5 \times (1-S5) + A6 \times (1-S6) + A7 \times (1-S7)
  \end{split}
}{3} = 44
\end{equation}

At this point it is more useful to represent the constraints using a
programming language. We will use a language called Sugar\cite{sugar},
which represents constraints as a series of Lisp-like
\textit{s-expressions}\cite{McCarthy:1960:RFS:367177.367199}. Sugar
allows exceedingly complex constraints to by created and tested in a
straightforward manner. 

For example, the constraint in Equation~\ref{eq1} can be encoded as the following
s-expressions, which declares each of the variables to have the values
0 or 1 and then states that they must sum to three:
\begin{Verbatim}
(int S1 0 1) (int S2 0 1) (int S3 0 1) (int S4 0 1)
(int S5 0 1) (int S6 0 1) (int S7 0 1)
(= (+ S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7) 3)
\end{Verbatim}

Although this directly represents the problem, we can write code
that's easier to understand by using the C preprocessor to implement
simple text macros, and using Sugar's \texttt{if} clause, to make it
very clear that we have a constraint that counts the number of males:

\begin{Verbatim}
#define FEMALE 0
#define MALE   1
(= (+ (if (= S1 MALE) 1 0)  
      (if (= S2 MALE) 1 0)
      (if (= S3 MALE) 1 0)
      (if (= S4 MALE) 1 0)
      (if (= S5 MALE) 1 0)
      (if (= S6 MALE) 1 0)
      (if (= S7 MALE) 1 0)
      )
   3)
\end{Verbatim}

With this notation, it is straightforward to create a constraint for
mean age of male persons:

\begin{Verbatim}
(= (+ (if (= S1 MALE) A1 0)    ; average male age = 44
      (if (= S2 MALE) A2 0)
      (if (= S3 MALE) A3 0)
      (if (= S4 MALE) A4 0)
      (if (= S5 MALE) A5 0)
      (if (= S6 MALE) A6 0)
      (if (= S7 MALE) A7 0)
      )
   (* 3 44))
\end{Verbatim}

Creating constraints for medians is more complicated. For odd numbered samples, the median is the value in the middle. With a sample size of three and a median of 30, there must be one age that is 30, one or more ages that are less than 30, and one or more ages that are more than 30:

\begin{Verbatim}
(= (+ (if (and (= S1 MALE) (= A1 30)) 1 0)
      (if (and (= S2 MALE) (= A2 30)) 1 0)      
      (if (and (= S3 MALE) (= A3 30)) 1 0)      
      (if (and (= S4 MALE) (= A4 30)) 1 0)      
      (if (and (= S5 MALE) (= A5 30)) 1 0)      
      (if (and (= S6 MALE) (= A6 30)) 1 0)      
      (if (and (= S7 MALE) (= A7 30)) 1 0)
      )
   1)

(>= (+ (if (and (= S1 MALE) (<= A1 30)) 1 0)
       (if (and (= S2 MALE) (<= A2 30)) 1 0)      
       (if (and (= S3 MALE) (<= A3 30)) 1 0)      
       (if (and (= S4 MALE) (<= A4 30)) 1 0)      
       (if (and (= S5 MALE) (<= A5 30)) 1 0)      
       (if (and (= S6 MALE) (<= A6 30)) 1 0)      
       (if (and (= S7 MALE) (<= A7 30)) 1 0)
       )
    1)

(>= (+ (if (and (= S1 MALE) (>= A1 30)) 1 0)
       (if (and (= S2 MALE) (>= A2 30)) 1 0)      
       (if (and (= S3 MALE) (>= A3 30)) 1 0)      
       (if (and (= S4 MALE) (>= A4 30)) 1 0)      
       (if (and (= S5 MALE) (>= A5 30)) 1 0)      
       (if (and (= S6 MALE) (>= A6 30)) 1 0)      
       (if (and (= S7 MALE) (>= A7 30)) 1 0)
       )
    1)
\end{Verbatim}


We translated Table~\ref{fictional} into \NumSExpressions{} individual
S-expressions extending over \NumConstraintLines{} lines. 

There exists a \textit{solution universe} of all the possible
solutions to this set of simultaneous equations. If the solution
universe contains a single possible solution, then the published
statistics completely reveal the underlying confidential data. If
there are multiple satisfying solutions, then any element (person) in
common between all of the solutions is revealed. If the equations have
no solution, the set of published statistics are inconsistent.

\section{Solving the Constraints}
A straightforward but wildly inefficient approach to solving this
system of simultaneous equations is to perform a brute force
search---that is, to try all possible values of all possible variables
and record the ones that work.

Ordinarily a brute force search on even this toy problem would be
computationally infeasable: there are 7 age variables that can range from 0 to 115
and 21 binary variables (sex, race race and marital status). All
together, there are $116^{10} \times 2^{21} \approx 9.25
\times 10^{26}$ possible combinations. Even if we could try a billion
a second, trying all possible combinations would take 90,000 trillion
years. 

But there is no need to try all possible combinations: the highly
constrained system can frequently be solved automatically using a
program called a satisfiability (SAT) solver. These programs use
clever heuristics to solve a system of boolean equations and variables
that are represented in the conjunctive normal form (CNF). Even though worst case SAT
problems require exponential time to solve, modern SAT solvers can
frequently solve ``hard structured problems with over a million variables and
several million constraints,'' according to a review of SAT solvers by Gomes.\cite{Gomes200889} 

Many SAT solvers take their input in the so-called DIMACS file format,
which specifies a single equation in conjunctive normal form
(CNF). This format was popularized by the annual SAT Solver
Competition, which saw dramatic improvements in the speed of SAT
solvers between 2000 and 2015. 

Because the DIMACS file format is difficult to work with, we use Sugar
to encode the system of integer and logical constraints into a
system of boolean equations and variables. Integers, for example, are
encoded in a unary, with a variable that can range from 0 to 4 being
encoded as \Verb|0 0 0 0|, \Verb|1 0 0 0|, \Verb|1 1 0 0|,
\Verb|1 1 1 0| or \Verb|1 1 1 1|.  Sugar then runs the SAT
solver. Finally, Sugar decodes the boolean solution back into a list
of integers and their satisfying value. 

Our source input file consists of \NumSExpressions s-expressions in
\NumConstraintLines{} lines (minus comments).
This converts into
\NumVariables Boolean variables and \NumClauses CNF clauses. Using the
open source SAT solver PicoSAT\cite{Biere_picosatessentials}, we are able
to solve this system in typically less than 2 seconds on a 2013 MacBook Pro with a 2.8GHz Intel
i7 processor and 16GiB of RAM (although the program is not limited by
RAM). Sugar is able to find an exact solution with the constraints presented
in Table~\ref{fictional}; the output is given in Table~\ref{sugarbig} and is tabulated for readability.

\subsection{Exploring the Solution Universe}

Instead of simply finding a single satisfying solution, some SAT
solvers can find all possible solutions---that is, the sovler can
experimentally determine the entire solution universe. This lets us
experimentally determine the impact of censoring additional
statistics.

For example, 


\section{Defending Against a DRA}\label{solution}
There are three approaches for defending against a database reconstruction: publish less
statistical data, and apply noise (random changes) to the
statistical data being tabulated, or apply noise to the results after
the tabulation. We consider them in order below.

Although it might seem that publishing less statistical data is a
reasonable defense against the DRA, this choice may severely limit the number
of tabulations that can be published. A
related problem is that it may be computationally infeasible to
determine when a reconstruction is possible from limited publications.

A second approach is to apply noise to the data before
tabulation. For example, each respondent's age might be randomly
altered by a small amount, perhaps $-2 \ldots 2$; 
the statistical agency then tabulates the values. 
In this scenario, if the attacker performs a DRA, the result is the altered dataset, and not the underlying true values. Thus, if two responses
are processed with noise of this sort, there are now $5^2 = 25$
possible solutions. If noise infusion is applied to all 7 age
variables, there are $5^{7}=78,125$ possible
solutions. Database reconstruction may still be possible, but there is no
way to know which reconstructed databse is correct. 

A third approach is to use output noise infusion. Instead of reporting
precise answers for each of the quoted statics, each is reported with
the addition of noise.  With output noise infusion, the attacker must
revise each constraint from an equality to a bounded range, resulting
again in an explosion of possible solutions that is exponential in the
number of constraints. Exact solutions can still be found, but there
is no way for an attacker to determine which are correct.  Like input
noise infusion, output noise infusion does not prevent an attacker
from reconstructing the database, but it prevents the attacker from
knowing if the reconstruction is correct.

\textbf{How much noise should be added? --- have a brief intro to
  differential privacy here, and then the big finish.}

\section{Related Work}

Dinur and Nissim\cite{noise} showed that the underlying
confidential data of a statistical database can be reconstructed with
a surprisingly small number of queries. In practice, most statistical
agencies perform these queries themselves when they release
statistical tables. Thus, Dinur and Nissim's primary finding
is: a statistical agency that publishes too many accurate statistical
tables drawn from the same confidential dataset risks inadvertently
compromising that dataset unless it takes specific protective measures.

Statistical tables create the possibility of database reconstruction
because they form a set of constraints for which there is ultimately
only one exact solution. Restricting
the number or specific types of queries---for example, by suppressing
results from a small number of respondents---is often insufficient to prevent access
to indirectly identifying information, because the system's refusal to
answer a ``dangerous'' query itself provides the attacker with information. 
Dinur and Nissim found that, if a database is modeled as a string of $n$ bits,
then at least $\sqrt{n}$ bits must be modified by adding noise to
protect persons from being identified.

Kasiviswanathan, Rudelson, and Smith\cite{Kasiviswanathan:2013:PLR:2627817.2627919} introduced
the concept of the linear reconstruction attack, which underlies the  DRA. The key concept is that,
given nonsensitive data such as zip code or gender, an attacker
can construct a matrix of linear equalities that can often be solved
in polynomial time. The paper also analyzes a common reconstruction
technique known as least squares decoding, where the attacker sets up
a goal function to minimize the square of the distance between two
databases in order to reconstruct the original database.

Brown and Heathers\cite{doi:10.1177/1948550616673876} developed the
granularity-related inconsistency of means (GRIM) test in response to
observed inconsistencies in published data from psychological
journals. This test is centered around the premise that, for
statistics drawn from integer data, only certain means are
possible. The GRIM test determines whether reported means could
possibly have come from data sets with a certain size, granularity,
and group number. In surveying 71 published articles, the authors
found 36 papers with one inconsistency and 16 with two or more
inconsistencies. Although this test was intended to detect possible
errors or mean falsification in published articles, the concept of
drawing inferential conclusions about a data set based only on 
published statistics is a key concept behind the DRA.


\section{Conclusion}

With the dramatic improvement in the efficiency of SAT solvers in the
last decade, database reconstruction attacks are no longer just a 
theoretical danger. The vast quantity of data products published by
statistical agencies each year may give a determined attacker 
more than enough constraints to reconstruct some or all of a target database and
breach the privacy of millions of people. Although a suite of traditional
disclosure avoidance technique is often sufficient to defend against a cursory attack, cell suppression and generalization are not secure against more sophisticated
forms of attack. Agencies may also be using input and output noise infusion, but 
current systems may not be noisy enough to materially control the DRA risk.
Formal privacy methods, especially differential privacy, were specifically
designed to to control this risk and, as both of our noise-infusion examples
illustrate, they do so by systematically expanding the universe of solutions
to the DBA constraints. In this expanded universe, the real confidential data
are but a single solution, and no evidence in the published data can improve 
an attacker's guess about which solution is the correct one.

\subsection{SAT and SAT Solvers}

The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) was the first
problem to be proven NP-complete\cite{cooklevin}. This problem asks,
for a given Boolean formula, whether replacing each variable with
either True or False can make the formula evaluate to True.  A
consequence of SAT being NP-complete is that any problem can be
reduced in polynomial time (i.e., quickly) to an instance of the SAT
problem. Once a problem has been reduced to an instance of the SAT
problem, this SAT problem can be fed into a SAT solver to find
possible solutions. Although the SAT problem is not solvable by
algorithms in polynomial time, researchers have found many heuristic
techniques for expediting this process. SAT solvers combine a variety
of these techniques into one complex process, resulting in polynomial
time solutions for the SAT problem in many cases.

Modern SAT solvers use a heuristic technique called Conflict-Driven
Clause Learning, commonly referred to as CDCL\cite{cdcl}. Briefly, CDCL algorithm
is:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Assign a value to a variable arbitrarily.
\item Use this assignment to determine values for the other variables
  in the formula (a process known as unit propagation).
\item If a conflict is found, backtrack to the clause that made the
  conflict occur and undo variable assignments made after that point.
\item Add the negation of the conflict-causing clause as a new clause
  to the master formula and resume from step 1.

\end{enumerate}

This process is much faster at solving SAT problems than previous
processes used in SAT solvers because adding conflicts as new clauses
has the potential to avoid wasteful ``repeated backtracks.''
Additionally, CDCL and its predecessor algorithm, DPLL, are both
provably complete algorithms and will always return either a solution
or ``Unsatisfiable'' if given enough time and memory.

There are a wide variety of SAT solvers available to the public for
minimal or no cost. Although a SAT solver requires the user to
translate the problem into Boolean formulae before use, programs such
as Naoyuki Tamura's Sugar facilitate this process by translating
user-input mathematical and English constraints into Boolean formulae
automatically.

\subsection{Sugar Input}

Sugar input is given in a standard Constraint Satisfaction Problem
(CSP) file format. A constraint must be given on a single line of the
file, but here we separate most constraints into multiple lines for
readability. Constraint equations are separated by comments describing
what statistics they encode.

Input for the model in this paper is as follows:
