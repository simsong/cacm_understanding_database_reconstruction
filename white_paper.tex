In recent years, a certain type of malicious database attack,
the database reconstruction attack, has become increasingly
more feasible due to rapid advances in attack algorithm
sophistication. Here, we will discuss how these attacks
function, demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency,
and provide solutions for defending against such an attack.

This paper will answer the following questions:

1. What is a database reconstruction attack (DRA)?
2. To what extent are modern DRAs effective in reconstructing
the ground truth data?
3. How scalable are DRAs with database size?
4. How can a statistical agency guard public data against a DRA without
significantly impacting the accuracy of the data?

We will also develop a vocabulary to facilitate the discussion
of database privacy and formally define some important terms.

Keywords: Database reconstruction attack, SAT solver, privacy,
disclosure avoidance
