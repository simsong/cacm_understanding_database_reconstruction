This project demonstrates the database reconstruction attack and its application to statistical collections.

We will work a simple problem.

Survey Questions:

Please provide the following for each member of your family:
* Age
* Sex
* Race
* Generation (1 = grandparent; 2 = parent; 3 = child)


Here is the ground truth:

Household #1:

24  Male   White      Parent
28  Female Black      Parent
55  Female White      Grandparent
5   Female Black      Child
8   Male   White      Child

Household #2:

50  Male   White      Parent
45  Male   White      Parent
15  Female White      Child
17  Female White      Child


Based on these returns, a statistical agency produces the following statistics:

Group           N     Avg(age)

individuals:    9     27.44
males:          4     31.75
females:        5     24
parents:        4     36.75
grandparents:   1     XXX
children 0-12:  2     6.5
children 13-17: 2     16
whites:         7     30.57
blacks:         2     16.5
black parents:  1     XXX
b. under 18:    1     XXX
white parents:  3     39.66
w. under 18:    3     13.33
households:     2     27.875  (average of the averages)
avg. household size: 4.5
avg. # of children per household: 2

Notes:
* By law, the agency will only report that households have 1 or 2 parents.


In this hypothetical example, the statistical agency implements a
"rule of 2," which is that any statistics that results from 2 or more
individuals may be reported, but any statistic from a single person
must be suppressed (indicated by XXX). Counts of 1 are released.
These rules obviously provide limited disclosure avoidance, but they
are sufficient for our example. If we applied additional disclosure
limitations, such as suppressing complementary values, we would
quickly realize that no statistics can be released at all. Which is
the point of this exercise...)

Based on these data, examine some of the reported averages and come up with the universe of possible solutions. For example:

* The two children aged 0-12 must have ages of either [6,7], [5,8], [4,9], [3,10], [2,11] or [1,12]. 

* The two children aged 13-18 must have ages of either [16,16] or [15,17].

* The households have sizes of either [4,5], [3,6], [2,7] or [1,8]

* The households either have [2,2] children or [1,3] children.

We can infer other things about the households. For example, we know
that there must be 2 parents in each household. We know that one
household has two white parents (WW) and the other has a white and a
black parent (WB). We know that there are 4 children, 3 white (www)
and 1 black (b). So there are only these possible combinations of
races in the households (excluding the grandparent):


          Household 1               Household 2
          Parents  Children         Parents Children
opt 1:      WW       ww               WB      wb
opt 2:      WW       wb               WB      ww
opt 3:      WW       www              WB      b
opt 4:      WW       wwb              WB      w

opt 5:      WB       ww               WW      wb
opt 6:      WB       wb               WW      ww
opt 7:      WB       www              WW      b
opt 8:      WB       wwb              WW      w

Notice that opt 1 & 5 are actually a single case with the labels on
households 1 & 2 swapped, as are opt 2 & 6. However, as we add more
variables, we may need to distinguish between household 1 & 2.

We haven't allocated the grandparents yet. From the statistics
reported we know that there is a single one, although we haven't yet
figured out the person's age or sex. Let's call this person G for
now. The person can be in household 1 or 2, so we now have 16 options:


          Household 1               Household 2
          Parents  Children         Parents Children
opt 1:   G  WW       ww               WB      wb
opt 2:   G  WW       wb               WB      ww
opt 3:   G  WW       www              WB      b
opt 4:   G  WW       wwb              WB      w

opt 5:   G  WB       ww               WW      wb
opt 6:   G  WB       wb               WW      ww
opt 7:   G  WB       www              WW      b
opt 8:   G  WB       wwb              WW      w

opt 9:      WW       ww             G WB      wb
opt 10:     WW       wb             G WB      ww
opt 11:     WW       www            G WB      b
opt 12:     WW       wwb            G WB      w

opt 13:     WB       ww             G WW      wb
opt 14:     WB       wb             G WW      ww
opt 15:     WB       www            G WW      b
opt 16:     WB       wwb            G WW      w

We thus have a growing number of constraints and a growing number of
possible solutions that solve these constraints. Given what we've
published so far, there are many ppossible solutions. However, the statistics agency is likely to be called upon to publish more summary information, such as 

* Number and average age of male and female adults, by race. (8 statistics)
* Number of children in same-sex households 
* Number of children living in multi-generational households

Each time an additional statistic is published, a new constraint is
created, and the universe of possible solutions decreases. At some
point it will be possible to reliably reconstruct some or all of the
original survey responses. 

So how do we reconstruct the database? 

Lets go back to the original survey results:

Household #1:

24  Male   White      Parent
28  Female Black      Parent
55  Female White      Grandparent
5   Female Black      Child
8   Male   White      Child

Household #2:

50  Male   White      Parent
45  Male   White      Parent
15  Female White      Child
17  Female White      Child


This can be written as a single database:

ID   HH  AGE  SEX  RACE  GEN
1    1   24   M    W     P
2    1   28   F    B     P
3    1   55   F    W     G
4    1    5   F    B     C
5    1    8   M    W     C
6    2   50   M    W     P
7    2   45   F    W     C
8    2   15   F    W     C
9    2   17   F    W     C

We'll make this a bit easier to process by transformating it into
numbers with this key:

Key: M=0 F=1
     W=0 B=1
     G=2 P=1 C=0

ID   HH  AGE  SEX  RACE  GEN
1    1   24   0    0     1
2    1   28   1    1     1
3    1   55   1    0     2
4    1    5   1    1     0
5    1    8   0    0     0
6    2   50   0    0     1
7    2   45   1    0     0
8    2   15   1    0     0
9    2   17   1    0     0

We're trying to reconstruct this database. When we start the
reconstruction problem, we don't know anything except the ID
numbers. We basically have 5 x 9 = 45 unknowns:


ID   HH  AGE  SEX  RACE  GEN
1    H1   A1   S1   R1    G1
2    H2   A2   S2   R2    G2
3    H3   A3   S3   R3    G3
4    H4   A4   S4   R4    G4
5    H5   A5   S5   R5    G5
6    H6   A6   S6   R6    G6
7    H7   A7   S7   R7    G7
8    H8   A8   S8   R8    G8
9    H9   A9   S9   R9    G9

Given this encoding, each of the official statistics can be turned
into a mathematical formual, which becomes a constraint. For example,
this statistic:

   individuals:    9     27.44

Becomes:

   INT(((A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 + A8 + A9) * 100 / 9 ) + 0.5) = 2744

Notice that we have addressed the issue of floating point rounding.


Other statistics can be encoded if we use special forms of boolean
operators that evaluate to 1 or 0. (That is, 1<2 evaluates to 1 and
1>2 evluates to 0.) Such an operator allows us to encode this official
statistic:

   grandparents:   1     XXX

As: 

   (G1==2) + (G2==2) + (G3==2) + (G4==2) + (G5==2) + 
   (G6==2) + (G7==2) + (G8==2) + (G9==2) = 1

This statistic:

   children 0-12:  2     6.5

Can be encoded as:

   (G1==0) + (G2==0) + (G3==0) + (G4==0) + (G5==0) + 
   (G6==0) + (G7==0) + (G8==0) + G9==0) = 2

and:

  (G1 * (G1==0) + 
   G2 * (G2==0) + 
   G3 * (G3==0) + 
   G4 * (G4==0) + 
   G5 * (G5==0) + 
   G6 * (G6==0) + 
   G7 * (G7==0) + 
   G8 * (G8==0) + 
   G9 * (G9==0)) = 13
   
Clearly, assumptions have to be made when the official statistics are
translated into constraints. For example, were the official statistics
calculated with ages first rounded to integer years, or number of months, or days?
Reconstruction will be easier if the database has years, rather than
days, simply because there are fewer possible solutions.

Once all of the official statistics are converted to mathematical
constraints, we have a system with 45 unknowns and a large number of
equations. If the statistical agency computed its results accurately,
we know that there is at least one solution of these 45 unknowns:

S1 = {H1=h1, H2=h2, ... H9=h9, A1=a1, A2=a2, A3=a3 ... A9=a9,  ... G9=g9}

However, there might be a whole universe of solutions. This is the
universe of possible database reconstructions:

U = {S1, S2, S3 ... Sn}

Each time the official statistics agency published another statistic,
this universe U shrinks in size. At some point, there is only one
element:

U = {Sg}

Sg is the ground truth solution.

Now it is likely that there are common elements between different
solution sets. For example, if U only has two possible solutions, and
they have a set of variables in common, then those elements must be in
the ground truth as well:

if
   U = {S1, S2}
and
   S1 âˆ© S2 = {H1=h1, A1=a1, S1=s1, R1=r1, G1=g1}

... then we know that {h1, a1, a1, r1, g1} is an actual person in the
ground truth set.


There are at least three possible ways of solving for the 45 unknown
variables. 



   





We are looking for a set of values for these  45 variables that are
consistent with the constraints. 

However, we can create a set of constraints for the ages and races of each individual in this dataset. Assume that our individuals have ages A1 .. A8. We know that:
