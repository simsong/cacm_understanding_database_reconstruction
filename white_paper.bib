abstract = "Publisher Summary The past few years have seen enormous progress in the performance of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers. Despite the worst-case exponential run time of all known algorithms, satisfiability solvers are increasingly leaving their mark as a general-purpose tool in areas as diverse as software and hardware verification, automatic test-pattern generation, planning, scheduling, and even challenging problems from algebra. Annual \{SAT\} competitions have led to the development of dozens of clever implementations of such solvers, exploration of new techniques, and creation of an extensive suite of real-world instances as well as challenging hand-crafted benchmark problems. Modern \{SAT\} solvers provide a black-box procedure that can often solve hard structured problems with over a million variables and several million constraints. This chapter describes the main solution techniques used in modern \{SAT\} solvers, classifying them as complete and incomplete methods. It discusses recent insights explaining the effectiveness of these techniques on practical \{SAT\} encodings and presents several extensions of the \{SAT\} approach currently under development. These extensions further expand the range of applications to include multiagent and probabilistic reasoning. "
